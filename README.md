# WCCI 2026 Special Session Website

This is a minimal, single-file site ready for GitHub Pages deployment.

## Quick start
1. Create a new public repo on GitHub, e.g., `wcci-2026-special-session`.
2. Upload the files in this folder to the repo root.
3. In the repo settings, enable GitHub Pages and choose the `main` branch, root (`/`) folder.
4. Your site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/` shortly.

Optional: add a `CNAME` file with your custom domain.
